# Movie Recommendation System and K-means Analysis

This project includes a movie recommendation system and a K-means clustering analysis. It demonstrates data processing, clustering, and recommendation techniques using Jupyter notebooks.

## Features

- **K-means Clustering Analysis**:
  - Performed using `KMeansAnalysis.ipynb`.
  - Demonstrates the application of the K-means algorithm for clustering data.
  - Visualizes clusters and analyzes their properties.

- **Movie Recommendation System**:
  - Implemented in `MovieRecommendationSystem.ipynb`.
  - Recommends movies based on user ratings.
  - Utilizes collaborative filtering techniques.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive environment for data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for clustering.
- **Numpy**: Numerical computing library.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization libraries.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sairahulkan/Movie-Recommendation-System-and-K-means-Analysis.git
    cd Movie-Recommendation-System-and-K-means-Analysis
    ```

2. Install the necessary Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Start Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

4. Open the Jupyter notebooks:

    - `KMeansAnalysis.ipynb` for the K-means clustering analysis.
    - `MovieRecommendationSystem.ipynb` for the movie recommendation system.

## Data

- **data.csv**: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- **ratings_small.csv**: Contains movie ratings data for the recommendation system.

## Usage

1. **K-means Clustering Analysis**:
   - Open `KMeansAnalysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Run the cells sequentially to perform clustering and visualize the results.

2. **Movie Recommendation System**:
   - Open `MovieRecommendationSystem.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Run the cells sequentially to train the recommendation model and generate movie recommendations.
